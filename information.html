  <h2>Participant Information Sheet</h2>
  <p>This research is being conducted as part of an MSc thesis in Cognitive & Decision Sciences. The study explores emotional states and decision-making in social economic games.</p>

  <p>You will be asked to fill out short psychological questionnaires (e.g., mood and anxiety assessments), and then play a short interactive task (either a Dictator or Trust Game). The entire session will take about 15â€“20 minutes.</p>

  <p>Participation is voluntary, and you may stop at any time. Your responses will be anonymous and used only for academic research purposes. By continuing, you agree that you understand the procedures and consent to take part.</p>

  <p>If you have any questions, please contact the researcher at your_university_email@example.com.</p>
